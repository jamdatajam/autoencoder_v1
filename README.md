Description: Autoencoder test code for 4tend.com (ANN). Encodes then decodes 
to discover hidden base truths in datasets. As such, the latent variables are
the underlying patterns in the data that we can use to create reconstructions
of synthetic data points until realistic or natural seeming patterns appear.
Encoding is the compression of data into key patterns (lower dimensional space)
decoding is restoring new data from the detected underlying patterns (restores
the original dimensionality).
